# AUB-AI-SummerSchool
The Maroun Semaan Faculty of Engineering and Architecture (MSFEA) at the American University of Beirut(AUB) organized the Engineering For Good summer school 2019 where high-school students got the chance to learn about engineering and various skills. The main theme was Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, and it spanned during the first 3 weeks of July(July 1 -19). 

This repository includes the material covered during the summer school with code scripts, presentations, and descriptive guides. We first start with an introduction to Artificial Intelligence(AI), then cover the basics of data preprocessing and building Machine Learning models. We also go over more advanced topics like Natural Language Preprocessing and Computer Vision.
